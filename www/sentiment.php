	<p>Sentiment Analysis is Textalytics' solution for performing a detailed multilingual sentiment analysis of texts from different sources.</p>
	<p>The text provided is analyzed to determine if it expresses a positive/negative/neutral sentiment; 
	to do this, the local polarity of the different sentences in the text is identified and the relationship between them evaluated, 
	resulting in a global polarity value for the whole text.</p>

			<p>It allows expressions following the pattern: AnnotationType.FeatureName==FeatureValue. Not every element in the pattern must appear.
			For example you may want to specify just Type or Type.FeatureName.
			Only those Annotations that match the pattern will be used as input for the application.</p>

	<p>New Annotations will be created in the AnnotationSet defined by <code>outputASname</code>. 
	The Annotations created follow the structure of the <a href="<?php echo $URI;?>">API specification</a>.
	Sometimes you may find nested objects in the specification. Those objects are flattened using ";" as 1st level separator and "|" as 2nd level separator.
	</p>
	<p>Also, a list of entities and concepts with their sentiment scores will be created as Document Features. Again, ";" will be the 1st level separator, while "|" will split nested objects in a 2nd level of deepness</p>
