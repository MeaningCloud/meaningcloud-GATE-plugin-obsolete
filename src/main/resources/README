How to deploy GATE-repository:

	- Copy the new version of the plugin from the ../../dist folder to the distribution folder
	- Copy creole.xml, Textalytics.xgapp to the folder of the new plugin version
	- Modify the ID property of the CREOLE-DIRECTORY and the name of the jar to match the actual version
	- Create/Modify the symbolic link in order to point to the newest version with a folder called "Textalytics"
	- Zip the folder Textalytics and put it into <distro-folder>/Textalytics/Textalytics.zip


The final structure of the distro folder might look like:
	<distro-folder>
			- gate-update-site.xml
			- Textalytics/ -> ./Textalytics-[last_version]
			- Textalytics-1.0/
				- ...
			- Textalytics-1.1/
				- ...
			- ...
			- Textalytics-[last_version]/
				- creole.xml
				- Textalytics.zip
					- Textalytics/
						- creole.xml
						- Textalytics-[last_version].jar
						- Textalytics.xgapp
