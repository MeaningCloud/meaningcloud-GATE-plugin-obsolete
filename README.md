## How to use it
If you just want to use the plugin as it is, go to our [Download section](https://www.meaningcloud.com/developer/gate-plugin) and get the last version of the plugin. Load it as the other plugins in GATE. Refer to the [docs](https://www.meaningcloud.com/developer/gate-plugin/doc/2.0) for further info about plugin usage.

If you want to contribute or modify the plugin for personal use, fork the project. We really appreciate contributions, so pull requests are also very welcome! You can create your own project using ant with the build file we provide, but before doing this, if you didn't define the GATE_HOME environment variable, uncomment it from the build.xml and make it point your specific location.
