    <!-- SecciÃ³n -->
  	<p>	Lemmatization, PoS and Parsing is the name of Textalytics' API for the different basic linguistic modules.</p>
	  <p>Even though it is simple in name, the parser contains a myriad of functionalities derived from the complete morphosyntactic and semantic analysis it carries out. Instead of including different APIs to obtain all the possible features provided by this analysis, features are grouped in different operating modes, allowing the user to take advantage of as many of them as he wishes and to combine them with other Textalytics' features, such as Topics Extraction.</p>
