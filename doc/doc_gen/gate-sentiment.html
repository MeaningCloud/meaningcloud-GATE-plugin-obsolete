<h2 id="gt-API-sentiment">Sentiment Analysis API (v1.1)</h2>
	<p>Sentiment Analysis is Textalytics' solution for performing a detailed multilingual sentiment analysis of texts from different sources.</p>
	<p>The text provided is analyzed to determine if it expresses a positive/negative/neutral sentiment; 
	to do this, the local polarity of the different sentences in the text is identified and the relationship between them evaluated, 
	resulting in a global polarity value for the whole text.</p>
