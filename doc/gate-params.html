    <tbody>
      <tr>
    		<th class="name">inputASName</th>
        <td>Name of the <code>AnnotationSet</code> which will be used as input. If both this field and <code>inputASTypes</code> are unset, the whole document will be processed.</td>
      </tr>
    <tr>
    		<th class="name">inputASTypes</th>
        <td>
			<p>This parameter is defined as a way to filter which annotations you want to process.</p> 
      <p>It allows expressions that follow the pattern <code>AnnotationType.FeatureName==FeatureValue</code>. Not every element in the pattern has to appear.
      For example, you may want to specify just <code>Type</code> or <code>Type.FeatureName</code>. Only those annotations that match the pattern will be used as input for the application.</p>
      <p><strong>Hint:</strong> Take into account that this option will take longer to run because it will process individually the annotations matching the input.</p>
    </td>
      </tr>
    <tr>
   	 		<th class="name">debug</th>
        <td>In case of system failure, set it to <code>true</code> to get things logged and <a href="#gt-feedback">send us</a> the log's output.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
    		<th class="name">outputASName</th>
        <td>
					<p>Name given to the group of <code>Annotations</code> that this <code>Processing Resource</code> will produce.</p>
					<p>New <code>Annotations</code> will be created in the <code>AnnotationSet</code> defined by <code>outputASname</code>.</p>
             The <code>Annotations</code> created follow the structure of the <a href="http://textalytics.com/core/">API specification</a>.
  Sometimes you may find nested objects in the specification. Those objects are flattened using ";" as 1st level separator and "|" as 2nd level separator.</td>
